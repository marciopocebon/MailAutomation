Thomas here. Please Note:

1. Change the values in the Settings.ini to match your own environment.

2. I have tried to make the variable naming as clear as possible.

3. Apologies for the poor structure and poor architecture. 

4. If I had time, I would write tests and refactor as I usually do.

5. The prerequisite is that the Word Template File must be created and stored in the location in Settings.ini.

6. The Path to the WordTemplate File should be given in Settings.ini.

7. Nearly all fields in Settings.ini will have to be changed when you move to a new environment.

8. Working directory of the project is set to /MailAutomation, not /MailAutomation/bin/Debug. Please note.

9. Password for Dooblo is not really required, don't know why!
